\title{Get list of retrievable fields}
\usage{
get_fields(endpoint, groups = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{endpoint}{The API endpoint whose field list you want to get. See
\code{\link{get_endpoints}} for a list of the 27 endpoints.}

\item{groups}{A character vector giving the group(s) whose fields you want
returned. A value of \code{NULL} indicates that you want all of the
endpoint's fields (i.e., do not filter the field list based on group
membership). See the field tables located online to see which groups you
can specify for a given endpoint (e.g., the
\href{https://search.patentsview.org/docs/docs/Search\%20API/SearchAPIReference/#patent}{patent
endpoint table}), or use the \code{fieldsdf} table
(e.g., \code{unique(fieldsdf[fieldsdf$endpoint == "patent", "group"])}).}
}
\value{
A character vector with field names.
}
\description{
This function returns a vector of fields that you can retrieve from a given
API endpoint (i.e., the fields you can pass to the \code{fields} argument in
\code{\link{search_pv}}). You can limit these fields to only cover certain
entity group(s) as well (which is recommended, given the large number of
possible fields for each endpoint).

\examples{
# Get all assignee-level fields for the patent endpoint:
fields <- get_fields(endpoint = "patent", groups = "assignees")

# ...Then pass to search_pv:
\dontrun{

search_pv(
  query = '{"_gte":{"patent_date":"2007-01-04"}}',
  fields = fields
)
}
# Get all patent and assignee-level fields for the patent endpoint:
fields <- get_fields(endpoint = "patent", groups = c("assignees", "patents"))

\dontrun{
# ...Then pass to search_pv:
search_pv(
  query = '{"_gte":{"patent_date":"2007-01-04"}}',
  fields = fields
)
}
