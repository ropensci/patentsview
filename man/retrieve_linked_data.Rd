\title{Get Linked Data}
\usage{
retrieve_linked_data(url, api_key = Sys.getenv("PATENTSVIEW_API_KEY"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{The link that was returned by the API on a previous call.}

\item{api_key}{API key. See \href{https://patentsview.org/apis/keyrequest}{
Here} for info on creating a key.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed along to httr's \code{\link[httr]{GET}} or
\code{\link[httr]{POST}} function.}
}
\value{
A list with the following three elements:
\describe{
\item{data}{A list with one element - a named data frame containing the
data returned by the server. Each row in the data frame corresponds to a
single value for the primary entity. For example, if you search the
assignees endpoint, then the data frame will be on the assignee-level,
where each row corresponds to a single assignee. Fields that are not on
the assignee-level would be returned in list columns.}

\item{query_results}{Entity counts across all pages of output (not just
the page returned to you).}

\item{request}{Details of the HTTP request that was sent to the server.
When you set \code{all_pages = TRUE}, you will only get a sample request.
In other words, you will not be given multiple requests for the multiple
calls that were made to the server (one for each page of results).}
}
}
\description{
Some of the endpoints now return HATEOAS style links to get more data. E.g.,
the inventors endpoint may return a link such as:
"https://search.patentsview.org/api/v1/inventor/252373/"
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

retrieve_linked_data(
  "https://search.patentsview.org/api/v1/cpc_subgroup/G01S7:4811/"
 )
}
